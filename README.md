# darkweb

This used to be the repository holding the DarkScience website, that has been
moved to https://git.drk.sc/darkscience/darkscience.net.

At the moment this repository contains a Django application which powers the
quotes system for DarkScience. This is a legacy part of the old website still
in service.
